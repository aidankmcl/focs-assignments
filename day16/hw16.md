## I. (Undirected) Graphs

A **graph** is a set of points (called **nodes** or **vertices**), connected pair-wise by lines (called **edges**).

Formally, a graph is an ordered pair *G* = (*V*, *E*): *V* is a set of vertices; E is a set of edges; and an edge is a set of the nodes that are its ends.

*Example*:
(Example in pdf) <br>

*G* = ({1, 2, 3}, {{1, 2}, {1, 3}})

### 1. Match the diagrams to the graph structures.

(Diagrams in pdf)
<br>

(i) b = *G* = ({1, 2, 3, 4}, {{1, 2}, {1, 4}, {3, 4}})

(ii) a = *G* = ({1, 2, 3, 4}, {{1, 2}, {1, 4}, {2, 3}, {3, 4}})

(iii) d = *G* = ({1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, {{1, 2}, {1, 3}, {1, 4}, {1, 5}, {2, 5}})

(iv) c = *G* = ({1, 2, 3, 4}, {{1, 2}, {1, 4}, {1, 3}})

### 2. Cycles

Two vertices are **adjacent** if there's an edge between them.

A **cycle** is a sequence of adjacent vertices that begin and end with the same vertex.

Which of (1a-d) contains a cycle? For those graphs that contain a cycle, what is the cycle?

Answer: a and d contain cycles. <br>
For a: {{1, 2}, {2, 3}, {3, 4}, {1, 4}} <br>
For d: {{1, 2}, {2, 5}, {1, 5}} <br>


### 3. Draw a diagram for this graph.

*G* = ({1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, {{1, 2}, {2, 3}, {3, 4}, {4, 5}, {1, 5}})

### 4. Write the graph (V, E) for this diagram.

(Graph in pdf)
<br>

This is a single graph. It is not a **connected graph**.

*G* = ({1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, {{1, 2}, {1, 3}, {1, 4}, {2, 3}, {3, 4}, {3, 5}, {4, 5}})

## II. Directed Graphs

A **directed graph** (“digraph”) is a set of vertices, together with arrows that begin and end on a vertex.

Formally, *G* = (*V*, *A*), where *A* is a set of tuples $(V_i, V_j)$.

### 5. Match the diagrams to the graphs.

(Diagrams in pdf)<br>

(i) a = *G* = ({1, 2, 3, 4}, {(1, 2), (1, 4), (3, 2), (3, 4)})

(ii) c = *G* = ({1, 2, 3, 4}, {(1, 2), (1, 4), (4, 3)})

(iii) b = *G* = ({1, 2, 3, 4}, {(1, 2), (4, 1), (2, 3), (3, 4)})

### 6. Directed acyclic graphs

A cycle in a directed graph is a sequence of vertices, that starts and ends with the same vertex, where for each pair of consecutive vertices in the sequence there's an arrow from the first to the second.

A **directed acycle graph** (DAG) is a digraph that doesn't contain cycles.

Which of (5a-c) are DAGs?

Answer: a & c


### 7. Draw a diagram for this graph.

*G* = ({1, 2, 3, 4}, {(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (1, 3)})

![](https://github.com/aidankmcl/focs-assignments/blob/master/day16/images/directed-graph.png)

Is this graph a DAG?
Answer: No.

### 6. Write the graph (V, A) for this diagram.

(Digraph picture in pdf)
<br>

Answer: *G* = ({1, 2, 3, 4}, {(1, 2), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4)})
<br>

### 7. Adjacency matrices 

An **adjacency matrix** is a square matrix *A* such that $A_{i,j}$ = 1 iff there is an arrow from vertex *i* to vertex *j*.

Write the adjacency matrix for the graph in (5a).

*G* = ({1, 2, 3, 4}, {(1, 2), (1, 4), (3, 2), (3, 4)})

| <sub>j</sub> \ <sup>i</sup> | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
|--:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| 1 | x | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 2 | 0 | x | 1 | 0 |
| 3 | 0 | 0 | x | 0 |
| 4 | 0 | 0 | 1 | x |

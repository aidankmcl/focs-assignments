```

## I. Formal Proofs

Use the rules of inference from class (reprinted below) to construct formal, numbered proofs of the following:

### 1. 

Assuming _p -> q_ and _p -> r_, prove _p -> (q AND r)_ <br>
1. `p -> q`                Assume <br>
2. `p -> r`                Assume <br>
3. `(~p V q)`              1, Conditional <br>
4. `(~p V r)`              2, Conditional <br>
5. `(~p V q) ^ (~p V r)`   3, 4, Conjunction <br>
6. `~p V (q ^ r)`          5, Distributive <br>
7. `p -> (q ^ r)`          6, Conditional <br>


### 2.

Assuming _p -> (q OR r)_ and _p -> (q OR NOT r)_, prove _p -> q_ 
1. `p -> (q V r)` Assume <br>
2. `p -> (q V ~r)` Assume <br>
3. `~p V (q V r)`
4. `~p V (q V ~r)`
5. `(~p V q) V r`
6. `(~p V q) V ~r`
7. `~p V q`
8. `p -> q`


## II. Truth tables

Use a truth table to show the equivalence of the assumptions and conclusion from problem 1, above:  Assuming _p -> q_ and _p -> r_, prove _p -> (q AND r)_

[Style note:  what is the canonical order of the rows in a truth table for three propositions?]

|_p_|_q_|_r_|_p->q_|_p->r_|_p->(q^r)_|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:----:|:----:|:--------:|
| 0 | 0 | 0 |  1   |  1   |    1     |
| 0 | 0 | 1 |  1   |  1   |    1     |
| 0 | 1 | 0 |  1   |  1   |    1     |
| 0 | 1 | 1 |  1   |  1   |    1     |
| 1 | 0 | 0 |  0   |  0   |    0     |
| 1 | 0 | 1 |  0   |  1   |    0     |
| 1 | 1 | 0 |  1   |  0   |    0     |
| 1 | 1 | 1 |  1   |  1   |    1     |

## III. Tautology, satisfiable, contradiction

Which of the following are tautologies?  Satisfiable?  Unsatisfiable (contradictions)?

### 1. _(p AND q AND r) -> (p OR q)_
Answer: Tautolgy <br>

### 2. _((p -> q) AND (q -> r)) -> (p -> r)_
Answer: Tautology <br>

### 3. _(p -> q) -> p_
Answer: Satisfiable <br>

### 4. _(p OR q OR r) AND ((NOT p) OR (NOT q) OR (NOT r)) AND (p OR (NOT q)) AND (q OR (NOT r)) OR (r OR (not p))_ 
Answer: Satisfiable (p, ~q, ~r) <br>

### 5. [** challenge/optional] _(p <=> (q OR r)) -> ((NOT q) -> (p AND r))_
Answer:


## IV. CNF

Transform the following formula into conjunctive normal form.  Show your steps.

_p OR (q AND NOT (r AND (s -> t)))_

1. `p V (q ^ ~(r ^ (s -> t)))` Assume<br>
2. `p V (q ^ ~(r ^ (~s V t)))` 1, Conditional <br>
3. `p V (q ^ (~r V ~(~s V t)))` 2, De Morgan's <br>
4. `(p V q) ^ (p V (~r V ~(~s V t)))` 3, Distributive <br>
5. `(p V q) ^ ((p V ~r) V ~(~s V t))` 4, Associative <br>
6. `(p V q) ^ ((p V ~r) V (s ^ ~t))` 5, De Morgan's <br>


## V. Short certificate

Demonstrate that the formula in problem IV is satisfiable.  Explain whether you used a  "short certificate" or exhaustive enumeration to make this determination.

I couldn't find info in my notes or online about either terminology ("short certificate" or exhaustive enumeration) but I know that since the CNF is equivalent to the original expression, any set of representations that include a True value for _p_ will be True, thus the expression is satisfiable.

## 0. [Not a question] Terminology

In class on Monday, we drew [**call graphs**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_graph) of the `fib` function, with and without memoization.

This particular kind of call graph is a **dynamic call graph**, whose nodes are function *invocations* during the execution of a program. The nodes of a **static call graph** are function *names*; arrows indicate appearances of a call in the program source text.

A dynamic call graph of a *recursive* function is also called a **recursion graph**.

## 1. Predicate Calculus – Models

Consider Table 1:

| x    | y    |
| ---- | ---- |
| a    | b    |
| b    | c    |
| a    | c    |
| c    | d    |
| d    | c    |
| c    | c    |
| b    | a    |

*Table 1*: A model for `loves(x, y)`

a. For each of the following, is Table 1 a model?  Explain briefly why or why not.

1. ∃x. ∀y. loves(x, y)  - Answer: No, there are no values of x that love every value of y.
2. ∃y. ∀x. loves(x, y)  - Answer: Yes, 'c' is loved by every possible x value.
3. ∀x. ∃y. loves(x, y)  - Answer: Yes, assuming [a,b,c,d] contains all potential x values then all x's love some y.
4. ∀y. ∃x. loves(x, y)  - Answer: Yes, each y value is loved by at least one x value.
5. ∃x. ∃y. loves(x, y)  - Answer: Yes, there are some x values that love one or more y values.
6. ∃x. ∀y. ¬loves(x, y) - Answer: No, there are no x values that do not love any y values.
7. ∃x. ¬∀y. loves(x, y) - Answer: Yes, there are one or more x values that love some but not all y values.

b. Consider three models: (i) objects are a, b, c, d; `loves` is Table 1; (ii) objects are integers; `loves(x, y) ` ≝ x ≧ y; (iii) `loves(x, y)` ≝ x = y. In which of these models are these statements true:

| Statement                                | Table 1 | x ≧ y | x = y |
| ---------------------------------------- | :-----: | :---: | :---: |
| ∀x, x. loves(x, x)                       |         |       |   x   |
| ∀x, y. loves(x, y) → loves(y, x)         |         |       |   x   |
| ∀x, y, z. loves(x, y) ∧ loves(y, z) → loves(x, z) |         |   x   |   x   |

c. (Optional) (Because we love graphs) Draw Table 1 as a digraph. What claims do each of the following make about a node x or y, in terms of its indegree and outdegree?

1. ∀x. loves(x, y)
2. ∀y. loves(x, y)
3. ∃x. loves(x, y)
4. ∃y. loves(x, y)

## 2. Predicate Calculus – Proofs

Given axioms:

1. ∀x. sum( x, 0, x )
2. ∀x, y, z. sum( x, y, z ) → sum( x, s(y), s(z) )
3. ∀x . product( x, 0, 0 )
4. ∀x, y, z, k. product( x, y, z ) ∧  sum( x, z, k ) → product( x, s(y), k )

Prove:

1.  ∃x. sum( x, x, s(s(0)) )

Answer:
1. ∀x. sum( x, 0, x )   Axiom1
2. ∀x, y, z. sum( x, 0, x ) -> sum( x, s(0), s(x) )  1, Axiom2
3. ---
incomplete

2.  ∀x. sum( 0, x, x ) [hint:  induction]
incomplete

3.  [optional super-challenge] ∀x, y, z. sum( x, y, z ) → sum( y, x, z )

## 3. Maximum Subarray

The [maximum subarray problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_subarray_problem) (*aka* maximum contiguous subsequence, *aka* maximum value contiguous subsequence) is “the task of finding the contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional array of numbers which has the largest sum. For example, for the sequence of values −2, 1, −3, 4, −1, 2, 1, −5, 4; the contiguous subarray with the largest sum is 4, −1, 2, 1, with sum 6” ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/)).

```python
# Source: wikipedia 
def max_subarray(xs):
    max_ending_here = max_so_far = 0
    for x in xs:
        max_ending_here = max(0, max_ending_here + x)
        max_so_far = max(max_so_far, max_ending_here)
    return max_so_far
```

a. Draw a recursion graph of `max_subarray([−2, 1, −3, 4, −1, 2, 1, −5, 4])`.

b. Is `max_subarray` an example of divide and conquer? Why or why not? Answer: No, it isn't computing lower values that join together to form a result, it's replacing values when it encounters the newest, best fit. Although it does call a function on each, it's not recursively calling `max_subarray` on smaller versions of the same problem, only `max` for each subarray. 

c. Is `max_subarray` an example of dynamic programming? Why or why not? Yes, the function updates dynamic values as it traverses the input data and returns the best result once the array has been evaluated.

d. Consider a *memoized* version of `max_subarray`. (You don't need to produce code for this. You do need to understand what memoization does to a call graph.) Draw the recursion graph for `memoized_max_subarray([−2, 1, −3, 4, −1, 2, 1, −5, 4])`.

Answer: In this case, there are 8 calls to `max()` that have identical inputs, including position, that could be memoized. Therefore, some memo function would be called 18 times to check the inputs each time and `max` would only need to be called 14 times. If we count identical inputs that are out of order (since it doesn't matter for `max`) then there are 5 calls that could be memoized.

e. [Optional challenge] Produce working code for memoized `max_subarray`.

## 4. Binary Search

```python
def binary_search_array_helper(x, xs, left, right):
    if left == right: return None
    middle = int((left + right) / 2)
    if x < xs[middle]:
        return binary_search_array_helper(x, xs, left, middle)
    elif xs[middle] < x:
        return binary_search_array_helper(x, xs, middle, right)
    else:
        return middle

def binary_search_array(x, xs):
    return binary_search_array_helper(x, xs, 0, len(xs))
```

a. Above is an implementation of the [binary search algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm). Draw the recursion graph for `binary_search_array(3, [1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 13, 14]))`.

<img alt="Binary search call graph" src="https://github.com/aidankmcl/focs-assignments/blob/master/day19/binary_search1.png" width="300px"/>

b. Is `binary_search_array` an example of divide and conquer? Why or why not? Answer: Yes, the input is being subdivided into smaller problems until a result is found, recursively calling `binary_search_array_helper` on slices of the input to divide the problem.

c. Is `binary_search_array` an example of dynamic programming? Why or why not? Answer: No, each new slice of an array provided to `binary_search_array_helper` is a new subproblem and cannot be remembered for saving on future computation time.

d. Consider a memoized version of `binary_search_array_helper`. Draw the recursion graph for a function memoized `memoized_binary_search_array(3, [1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 13, 14]))` that calls `memoized_binary_search_array_helper`.

Answer: The graph is not affected because no subproblems are being repeated and therefore memoization only incurs a slight overhead.

<img alt="Binary search call graph" src="https://github.com/aidankmcl/focs-assignments/blob/master/day19/binary_search_memo.png" width="300px"/>

e. Under what circumstances does the `memoized_binary_search_array` present any benefits over the unmemoized original? How does this relate to (i) its recursion graph; (ii) the key attributes of a dynamic program?

Answer: If you had several arrays and within them a number of identical subarrays then you could see some improvement if you stored the resulting index and the subarray used to reach it; provided that the larger arrays broke up such that these subarrays would show up. Otherwise there's no advantage. Thus, for a single problem the recursion graph is not affected and this does not follow the key attribute of dynamic programming that looks for identical subproblems and eliminates duplicate computation.

f. [Optional challenge] Find the bug in `binary_search_array`. What input will cause it to fail? How can this be fixed? (Hint: it is a bug that appears for small arrays. Python is not susceptible to [this bug](https://research.googleblog.com/2006/06/extra-extra-read-all-about-it-nearly.html).)

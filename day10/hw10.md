Student Name: Aidan McLaughlin
Check one:
[ ] I completed this assignment without assistance or external resources.
[X] I completed this assignment with assistance from ___
   and/or using these external resources: __I googled to double check whether REs can match arbitrarily nested expressions, once I saw the answer I realized I should have found that in Sipser, my apologies__
```

## I. Logic

### 1.

The following tables are [truth tables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_table).

_true_ and _false_ are represented by `T` and `F`. _OR(false, true)_ is commonly written in [infix notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infix_notation): `F OR T`.

The second table shows the value of the function _a OR b_, for all possible values _a_ and _b_. For example, _false OR true_ (the second row) has the value _true_ (the final cell of that row).

_a_ | _b_ | _a_ AND _b_
----|-----|---
 F  |  F  | F
 F  |  T  | F
 T  |  F  | F
 T  |  T  | T

_a_ | _b_ | _a_ OR _b_
----|-----|---
 F  |  F  | F
 F  |  T  | T
 T  |  F  | T
 T  |  T  | T

_a_ | _b_ | _a_ XOR _b_
----|-----|---
 F  |  F  | F
 F  |  T  | T
 T  |  F  | T
 T  |  T  | F

a. Construct the truth table for _a XOR (b XOR a)_.

Answer:

_a_ | _b_ | _a XOR (b XOR a)_
----|-----|---
 F  |  F  | F
 F  |  T  | T
 T  |  F  | F
 T  |  T  | T


b. Which function corresponds to the English word "or", as used in "You will eat your meat OR you can't have any pudding" (where _a_ = "You will eat your meat" and _b_ = "you can't have any pudding").

Answer: XOR

## II. Questions 2â€“6 are the same as in-class activities 2-6

### 2.

Consider the following context-free grammar G:

```
E -> E + E | T         # <- added "| T"
T -> T x T | (E) | a
```

Convert G to a PDA.

### 3.

Convert grammar G from (2) to Chomsky Normal Form. 

Answer: 

E0 -> EE<sub>1</sub> | TT<sub>1</sub> | LT<sub>2</sub> | a <br/>
E -> EE<sub>1</sub> | TT<sub>1</sub> | LT<sub>2</sub> | a <br/>
T -> TT<sub>1</sub> | LT<sub>2</sub> | a <br/>
T1 -> MT <br/>
T2 -> ER <br/>
E1 -> PE <br/>
P -> + <br/>
M -> x <br/>
L -> ( <br/>
R -> ) <br/>
<br/>

### 4.

Is the grammar G's language a regular language? If yes, produce a FSA or regular expression for this language. If not, show this.

Answer:
No. Neither FSA nor RE can describe the language because it can be infinitely nested.


### 5.

Theorem 1: The language {a^n b^n c^n} is not a context-free language.

a. Use Theorem 1, together with the languages {a^i b^i c^j} and {a^i b^j c^j}, to show that the set of context-free languages is not closed under intersection.

Answer: The intersection between {a<sup>i</sup> b<sup>i</sup> c<sup>j</sup>} and {a<sup>i</sup> b<sup>j</sup> c<sup>j</sup>} is {a<sup>i</sup> c<sup>j</sup>}. If we take the permitted string aaaacc split this up into the form uv<sup>i</sup>xy<sup>i</sup>z such that u=a, v=a, x=a, y=a, z=cc or aa<sup>i</sup>aa<sup>i</sup>cc, an i value of 0 will generate the string aacc which contradicts the lanuages, thus the set of context-free languages is not closed under intersection.


b. Use the pumping lemma for context-free languages [Sipser pp. 125] to prove Theorem 1.

Answer: If we split up any string that may be created by the language of Theorem 1 into uv<sup>i</sup>xy<sup>i</sup>z, which we should be able to by the pumping lemma for CFLs, we see that v and y would need to be a combination of variables which is not allowed.

### 6.

Consider the context-free grammar G:

```
S -> NP VP
NP -> NP PP
NP -> DET N
VP -> V NP
VP -> VP PP
DET -> a | the
N -> boy | girl | flowers | binoculars
V -> touches | sees
PP -> P NP
P -> in | from | with
```

a. Show that the string "the girl touches the boy with the flower" has two
different leftmost derivations.
S1
-> NP VP <br/>
-> DET N VP <br/>
-> the N VP <br/>
-> the girl VP <br/>
-> the girl V NP<br/>
-> the girl touches NP <br/>
-> the girl touches NP PP<br/>
-> the girl touches DET N PP<br/>
-> the girl touches the N PP<br/>
-> the girl touches the boy PP<br/>
-> the girl touches the boy P NP<br/>
-> the girl touches the boy with NP<br/>
-> the girl touches the boy with DET N<br/>
-> the girl touches the boy with the N<br/>
-> the girl touches the boy with the flower<br/>

S2
-> NP VP <br/>
-> DET N VP <br/>
-> the N VP <br/>
-> the girl VP<br/>
-> the girl VP PP *<br/>
-> the girl V NP PP<br/>
-> the girl touches NP PP<br/>
-> the girl touches DET N PP<br/>
-> the girl touches the N PP<br/>
-> the girl touches the boy PP<br/>
-> the girl touches the boy P NP<br/>
-> the girl touches the boy with NP<br/>
-> the girl touches the boy with DET N<br/>
-> the girl touches the boy with the N<br/>
-> the girl touches the boy with the flower<br/>
<br/>

b. Describe in English the two different meanings of this sentence.

Answer: Either the girl is touching the boy who has a flower or is touching the boy using a flower.


c. Use G to generate another ambiguous sentence.

Answer: The boy sees the flowers with binoculars.


d. Modify G so that it generates strings with adjectives: `the girl saw the tall boy`, `the girl touches the boy with a purple flower`.

Answer:
```
S -> NP VP
NP -> NP PP
NP -> DET N
NP -> DET AN
AN -> ADJ N
VP -> V NP
VP -> VP PP
DET -> a | the
ADJ -> tall | short | quiet | loud | purple | red
N -> boy | girl | flowers | binoculars
V -> touches | sees
PP -> P NP
P -> in | from | with
```


You don't need to know this, but here's how the variable names relate to linguistics.

Variable | meaning
---|---
S | sentence
DET | determiner (article)
N | noun
NP | noun phrase
P | preposition
PP | prepositional phrase
V | verb
VP | verb phrase
